Gonna be redoing this - replace all the assets 
    with a "data" class, stores raw data and
    exposes processed and trimmed data

TODO LIST:
- write metric functions
- go back and add the risk free rate adjustment to ratios
    should that allow a varying rff? or just single value?
- should the metrics be classes?
    or are they fine as standalong functions?
- verify / write unit tests for the metrics
- write factor regression
